# computational-physics

This repository contains some Fortran90 programs I wrote during the computational physics course.

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
1. Diluted Ising 2D.      
   Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation is used to study the phase transition to a magnetized state occurring in a diluted 2D Ising model.

2. Driven Morse Using Runge Kutta.       
   I solved driven morse oscillator model using Runge Kutta algorithm, rather than Euler algorithm.

3. Fermi Surface Energy.      
   This program is designed to calculate the surface energy for given k in Pb(111) and Ag(111), both in infinite barrier and finite barrier. The formulas are calculated from free electron model and consider the restriction by metal film in z direction.

4. Integral Using Three Methods.     
   In this directory I used Monte Carlo, simpson and trapezoidal methods to calculate the integral for normal distribution from 0 to 1.

5. Pair Correlation Funtion.      
   sc.f90, bcc.f90, fcc.f90 and hcp.f90 realize the pair correlation functions for simple cubic(sc), body centered cubic(bcc), face centered cubic(fcc) and hexagonal close packed(hcp) crystal respectively.
